# Mob Clock

## About
In the times of learning at </salt> we needed to have a timer for our mob
to make us more organized, and to make it _actually useful_ I added the 
notifications and funny sound so we actually know by many ways that time
is over!

## How to use
Just head out to [this link](http://mobclock.github.io) to use it!
It's free, beautiful and free of ads of course!

## Problems
It's affected by drifting problem of `setInterval` and `setTimeout` so the
tab has to be active for it work.

## License
Nothing to worry about, copy all of it!
